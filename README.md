# EasyStay
 The EasyStay project aims to develop a web-based platform that simplifies the process of finding, booking and renting hotel rooms and Paying Guest (PG) accommodations. The platform will cater primarily to students, working professionals and tourists looking for affordable and convenient hotel rooms and PG accommodations in cities.
